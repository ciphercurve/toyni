## 0. Background, STARK Verifier: Constraint vs FRI Layer Checks

## ‚úÖ Constraint Check (Single Layer)
- For each randomly sampled point `x`:
  - Verifier checks:
    ```
    Q(x) * Z(x) == C(x)
    ```
  - Ensures that the execution trace satisfies all constraints
  - **This check is done once per point**
  - **Not done across layers**
  - Merkle proof is optional (depends on how C(x) and Q(x) are committed)

---

## ‚úÖ FRI Layer Checks (Multiple Layers)
- Purpose: Prove that `Q(x)` is a **low-degree polynomial**
- Process:
  1. Start with evaluations of `Q(x)` over the domain (Layer 0)
  2. Recursively apply `fri_fold()` to reduce degree at each layer
  3. At each layer:
     - Verifier checks Merkle proofs for sampled values
     - Verifies that folding is consistent with previous layer
  4. Final layer should be constant or degree-1, checked directly

- ‚úÖ Merkle proofs are **checked at each FRI layer**
- ‚úÖ Folding correctness is verified at each layer

## üîê STARK Verifier: Security Parameters for 128-bit Soundness

### FRI QUERIES
To achieve **128-bit soundness** in STARK proofs, the total probability that a cheating prover is accepted must be less than `2‚Åª¬π¬≤‚Å∏`.

This involves carefully choosing parameters for:

- Constraint checks (`Q(x)` evaluations)
- FRI protocol (number of layers and queries per layer)

> Example:
> - If `L = 20` layers ‚Üí `log‚ÇÇ(20) ‚âà 4.3`
> - Then: `m ‚âà 133` queries per layer
---

### CONSTRAINT CHECKS
> Example:
> - If `d / N = 1/4`, then `log‚ÇÇ(N/d) = 2`
> - So: `n = 128 / 2 = 64` spot checks

> - If `d / N = 1/8`, then `log‚ÇÇ(N/d) = 3`
> - So: `n = 128 / 3 ‚âà 43`, but round up to be safe
---

### ‚úÖ Practical Recommendation:
Use `n = 64‚Äì80` spot checks for strong 128-bit soundness across typical domain/degree ratios.

### ‚úÖ Recommendations for 128-bit Security

| Component              | Suggested Value                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Constraint checks `n` | 64‚Äì80                              |
| FRI layers `L`        | log‚ÇÇ(N / degree of final poly)     |
| FRI queries `m`       | ‚â• log‚ÇÇ(L) + 128 (e.g., 133)        |
| Total soundness error | Œµ_total = Œµ_constraints + Œµ_fri ‚â§ 2‚Åª¬π¬≤‚Å∏ |

## 1. Introduction

STARKs are a powerful cryptographic tool that enables proving the correct execution of a computation without revealing the underlying data. Think of it as a way to convince someone that you know the solution to a puzzle without actually showing them the solution. This property, known as zero-knowledge, is crucial for privacy-preserving applications in areas like financial transactions, voting systems, and private identity verification.

### 2. Why STARKs Matter

| Scalability | Transparency | Zero-Knowledge |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| ‚Ä¢ O(log¬≤ n) proof size | ‚Ä¢ No trusted setup | ‚Ä¢ Privacy |
| ‚Ä¢ Fast verify | ‚Ä¢ Public parameters | ‚Ä¢ Confidentiality |
| ‚Ä¢ Efficient | | ‚Ä¢ Data protection |
| | | ‚Ä¢ Secure sharing |

### 3. Real-World Applications

| Financial | Identity | Computing |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| ‚Ä¢ Private payments | ‚Ä¢ Age verification | ‚Ä¢ Confidential computing |
| ‚Ä¢ Asset ownership | ‚Ä¢ Credential validation | ‚Ä¢ Private ML |
| | | ‚Ä¢ Secure MPC |

## 4. Technical Overview

At its heart, Toyni consists of three main components working together:

| Virtual Machine | Constraint System | STARK Prover |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| ‚Ä¢ Executes programs | ‚Ä¢ Defines rules | ‚Ä¢ Generates proofs |
| ‚Ä¢ Creates traces | ‚Ä¢ Validates states | ‚Ä¢ Uses FRI protocol |

### 5. How It Works

| Program Execution | Execution Trace | Verification |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| ‚Ä¢ Run program | ‚Ä¢ Record states | ‚Ä¢ Sample positions |
| ‚Ä¢ Track state | ‚Ä¢ Build constraints | ‚Ä¢ Check constraints |
| ‚Ä¢ Generate trace | | |

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how Toyni works. We'll create a program that proves a sequence of numbers increments by 1 each time:

```rust
fn test_valid_proof() {
    let mut trace = ExecutionTrace::new(4, 1);
    for i in 0..4 {
        let mut row = HashMap::new();
        row.insert("x".to_string(), i);
        trace.insert_column(row);
    }

    let mut constraints = ConstraintSystem::new();
    constraints.add_transition_constraint(
        "increment".to_string(),
        vec!["x".to_string()],
        Box::new(|current, next| {
            let x_n = Fr::from(*current.get("x").unwrap() as u64);
            let x_next = Fr::from(*next.get("x").unwrap() as u64);
            x_next - x_n - Fr::ONE
        }),
    );
    constraints.add_boundary_constraint(
        "starts_at_0".to_string(),
        0,
        vec!["x".to_string()],
        Box::new(|row| Fr::from(*row.get("x").unwrap() as u64)),
    );

    let prover = StarkProver::new(&trace, &constraints);
    let proof = prover.generate_proof();
    let verifier = StarkVerifier::new(&constraints, trace.height as usize);
    assert!(verifier.verify(&proof));
}
```

This example demonstrates how Toyni can prove that a sequence of numbers follows a specific pattern (incrementing by 1) without revealing the actual numbers. The proof can be verified by anyone, but the actual values remain private.

### 6. Security Properties

STARKs achieve their security through a combination of domain extension and low-degree testing. Here's how it works:

| Domain Extension | Low-Degree Testing | Soundness Guarantees |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| ‚Ä¢ Extend domain | ‚Ä¢ FRI protocol | ‚Ä¢ Soundness error: (1/b)^q |
| ‚Ä¢ Blowup factor | ‚Ä¢ Polynomial degree | ‚Ä¢ Query complexity |

The security of a STARK proof relies on two key mechanisms:

1. **Domain Extension (Blowup)**: The composition polynomial is evaluated over a domain that's `b` times larger than the original trace length, where `b` is the blowup factor.

2. **Low-Degree Testing**: The FRI protocol ensures that the polynomial being tested is close to a valid low-degree polynomial.

The soundness error (probability of accepting an invalid proof) is bounded by:

```
Pr[undetected cheat] = (1/b)^q
```

where:
- `b` is the blowup factor (e.g., 8 in our example)
- `q` is the number of queries made by the verifier

This means that if a prover tries to cheat by modifying a fraction 1/b of the domain, the verifier will detect this with probability at least 1 - (1/b)^q. For example, with a blowup factor of 8 and 10 queries, the soundness error is at most (1/8)^10 ‚âà 0.0000001.

## 7. Project Structure

The codebase is organized into logical components:

| Math | VM | Library |
|------|----|---------|
| ‚Ä¢ Polynomial | ‚Ä¢ Constraints | ‚Ä¢ Entry point |
| ‚Ä¢ Domain | ‚Ä¢ Trace | ‚Ä¢ Public API |
| ‚Ä¢ FRI | ‚Ä¢ Execution | ‚Ä¢ Documentation |
| ‚Ä¢ STARK | | |


### 8. Current Features

| Constraint System | FRI Protocol | Mathematical Operations |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| ‚Ä¢ Transition constraints | ‚Ä¢ Low-degree testing | ‚Ä¢ Polynomial arithmetic |
| ‚Ä¢ Boundary constraints | ‚Ä¢ Interactive verification | ‚Ä¢ Field operations |
| ‚Ä¢ Quotient verification | ‚Ä¢ FRI folding layers | ‚Ä¢ Domain operations |
| ‚Ä¢ Merkle commitments | ‚Ä¢ Folding consistency checks | ‚Ä¢ Secure commitments |

### 9. Missing Components

| Zero-Knowledge | Fiat-Shamir Transform | Performance |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| ‚Ä¢ Trace privacy | ‚Ä¢ Deterministic hashing | ‚Ä¢ Parallel processing |
| ‚Ä¢ State protection | ‚Ä¢ Non-interactive proofs | ‚Ä¢ Batch verification |
| ‚Ä¢ Circuit-specific | ‚Ä¢ Secure randomness | ‚Ä¢ Optimized FRI |

While we have a working STARK implementation with quotient polynomial verification and FRI folding, there are still some components to implement:

1. **Fiat-Shamir Transform**: Currently using random number generation instead of deterministic hashing, making the protocol interactive.
2. **Performance Optimizations**: Need to implement parallel processing and batch verification for better scalability.
3. **Circuit-Specific Features**: Add support for specialized circuits and optimizations.

### 11. Security Properties

STARKs achieve their security through a combination of domain extension, low-degree testing, and Merkle commitments. Here's how it works:

| Domain Extension | Low-Degree Testing | Merkle Commitments |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| ‚Ä¢ Extend domain | ‚Ä¢ FRI protocol | ‚Ä¢ Tree structure |
| ‚Ä¢ Blowup factor | ‚Ä¢ Polynomial degree | ‚Ä¢ Proof generation |
| ‚Ä¢ Soundness | ‚Ä¢ Folding checks | ‚Ä¢ Commitment verification |

The security of a STARK proof relies on three key mechanisms:

1. **Domain Extension (Blowup)**: The composition polynomial is evaluated over a domain that's `b` times larger than the original trace length.

2. **Low-Degree Testing**: The FRI protocol ensures that the polynomial being tested is close to a valid low-degree polynomial, with folding consistency checks at each layer.

3. **Merkle Commitments**: Each FRI layer is committed using a Merkle tree, ensuring the integrity of the folding process and enabling efficient verification.

The soundness error (probability of accepting an invalid proof) is bounded by:

```
Pr[undetected cheat] = (1/b)^q
```

where:
- `b` is the blowup factor (e.g., 8 in our example)
- `q` is the number of queries made by the verifier

This means that if a prover tries to cheat by modifying a fraction 1/b of the domain, the verifier will detect this with probability at least 1 - (1/b)^q. For example, with a blowup factor of 8 and 10 queries, the soundness error is at most (1/8)^10 ‚âà 0.0000001.
